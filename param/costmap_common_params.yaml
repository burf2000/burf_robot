obstacle_range: 2.5 # The maximum range in meters at which to insert obstacles into the costmap using sensor data. default 2.5
raytrace_range: 3.0 # The maximum range in meters at which to raytrace out obstacles from the map using sensor data. default 3.0
footprint: [ [0.08, 0.08], [-0.08, 0.08], [-0.08, -0.08], [0.08, -0.08] ]
#footprint: [ [0.55, 0.45], [-0.55, 0.45], [-0.55, -0.45], [0.55, -0.45] ] # SThe footprint of the robot specified in the robot_base_frame coordinate frame as a list in the format: [ [x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...., [xn, yn] ]. The footprint specification assumes the center point of the robot is at (0.0, 0.0) in the robot_base_frame and that the points are specified in meters, both clockwise and counter-clockwise orderings of points are supported.
inflation_radius: 0.55 # The radius in meters to which the map inflates obstacle cost values. default 0.55

transform_tolerance: 0.5 #Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds.

# voxel map configuration; z-voxels 0 are filled by bumpers and 1 by laser scan (kinect)
map_type: costmap # What map type to use. "voxel" or "costmap" are the supported types, with the difference between them being a 3D-view of the world vs. a 2D-view of the world.
#origin_z: 0.0 # The z origin of the map in meters. default 0.0
#z_resolution: 0.2 # The z resolution of the map in meters/cell. default 0.2
#z_voxels: 2 # The number of voxels to in each vertical column, the height of the grid is z_resolution * z_voxels. default 10
#publish_voxel_map: false # Whether or not to publish the underlying voxel grid for visualization purposes. default false

observation_sources: scan #bump # A list of observation source names separated by spaces. This defines each of the <source_name> namespaces defined below.
scan: {data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true} # min_obstacle_height: 0.0, max_obstacle_height: 0.2
#bump: {data_type: PointCloud2, topic: mobile_base/sensors/bumper_pointcloud, marking: true, clearing: false, min_obstacle_height: 0.0, max_obstacle_height: 0.15}
