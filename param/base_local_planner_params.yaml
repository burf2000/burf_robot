# Robot Configuration Parameters
  max_vel_x: 0.5 # 0.3 The maximum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec default 0.5
  min_vel_x: 0.1 #The minimum forward velocity allowed for the base in meters/sec. It is useful to specify this to guarantee that velocity commands sent to a mobile base are high enough to allow the base to overcome friction. default 0.1

  max_vel_theta:  1.5  # 1.0 The maximum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec default 1
  min_vel_theta: -1.5  # -1.0 The minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base in radians/sec default -1
  min_in_place_vel_theta: 1.0 # 0.6 The minimum rotational velocity allowed for the base while performing in-place rotations in radians/sec default 0.4
  
  acc_lim_theta: 3.2
  acc_lim_x: 2.5
  acc_lim_y: 2.5

# Differential-drive robot configuration
  holonomic_robot: false # Determines whether velocity commands are generated for a holonomic or non-holonomic robot. For holonomic robots, strafing velocity commands may be issued to the base. For non-holonomic robots, no strafing velocity commands will be issued. default true
